# Jack Compiler -- Project 10

This repository is part of the frontend for building the Jack Compiler.

I did not submit Project 10 due to issues with the course itself.

I am not sure if I will build the code generator at all, but I still believe that the grammar inside this repository is 99.9% complete.
